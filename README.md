# Project: Hangman

I had to build a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer. 

I downloaded the 5desk.txt dictionary file from http://scrapmaker.com/. When a new game is started, 
the script should load in the dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.

I implemented the functionality where, at the start of any turn, instead of making a guess the player should also have the option to save the game or load a saved 
game by serializing the game class.
